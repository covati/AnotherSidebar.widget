This is very purpose-built, it downloads a wiki page (if enough time has passed so that local data is stale) and parses the results of a table It then stores it locally. That data is used to populate a grid in the sidebar.
This obviously requires a bit of custom code. Also the username and password for the wiki are stored in .dotfiles that are referenced in the scripts.
